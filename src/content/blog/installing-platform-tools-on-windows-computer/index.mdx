### Run the commands

*   Browse to the folder where you have extracted the files. In this example it would be the `platform-tools` folder in `C:` drive
*   You will need to open a command prompt window inside this folder for adb or fastboot to work.

### Open a command prompt window inside a folder in windows

*   One of the ways to open a command prompt window inside a folder in windows is to check the address bar
*   A normal address bar in Windows will show you the file path of the current folder

*   Select the address bar and type `cmd` and hit enter

*   This will open a command prompt window as shown here

*   In this command prompt window you can now execute your adb or fastboot commands.
